# TERP Tutorial
Thermodynamically Explainable Representations of AI and other black-box Paradigms


Aim of this tutorial is to introduce users to the Thermodynamics-inspired Explainable Representations of AI and other black-box Paradigms (TERP) method implemented in Python (3 main scripts) for generating efficient, highly human-interpretable feature importance attribution for any ML model and for a variety of data types. The tutorial was designed for Google Colab but with minor adjustments can be run elsewhere.
